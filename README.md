# Portfolio Website

This is a simple, clean, and responsive portfolio website for software engineers.

## How to Customize

1.  **`index.html`**:
    *   Replace `"Your Name"` in the footer with your name.
    *   Update the "About Me" section with your own information.
    *   Fill in the "Projects" section with your projects. You can add more project cards if needed.
    *   Update the "Skills" section with your skills.
    *   Change the email address in the "Contact" section.

2.  **`style.css`**:
    *   You can change the color scheme by modifying the color values. The primary color is `#007bff`.

3.  **`script.js`**:
    *   This file contains the JavaScript for the mobile navigation menu. You probably won't need to change this unless you want to add more interactivity.

## How to Deploy

You can deploy this website for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  Upload the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to the repository.
3.  In your repository's settings, go to the "Pages" section.
4.  Select the `main` branch as the source and click "Save".
5.  Your website will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.
